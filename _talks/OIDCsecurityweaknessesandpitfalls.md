Best current practices (BCPs) for implementing OAuth2 and OIDC have undergone many changes over the years. While following the BCPs itâ€™s still easy to make mistakes and you might end up with a weak or even broken implementation. Based on our experiences performing penetration tests and security reviews, this presentation will show common OAuth2/OIDC security weaknesses and pitfalls. 

In particular concerning the BFF-pattern and why it is bad practice to use reverse proxy catch-all routing, an OAuth2 client with access to many scopes, together with APIs that do authorization based on just a valid token and scopes. Does your BFF enable authenticated SSRF as a Service?
