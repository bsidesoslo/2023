Join Swan Beaujard and Gautier Ben Aïm for an incisive look at GraphQL vulnerabilities. This groundbreaking research, involving a scan of over 1500 GraphQL endpoints, revealed a staggering 46,000+ security issues and sensitive data leaks, all accessible without authentication and with 10% classified as critical.

In this session, Gautier and Swan will share their unique testing methodology and delve into the most common GraphQL vulnerabilities unearthed during their research. They'll expose GraphQL-specific vulnerabilities, including complexity issues and schema leaks, alongside persistent standard API security threats like injections and server errors.

They'll also highlight the often-underestimated problem of data leaks, including sensitive personal information and tokens. But, they won't leave you in the trenches; they'll showcase practical remediation strategies, introducing tools like GraphQL Armor and a handy security checklist for developers.

This talk isn't just about raising alarms; it's about equipping you with the tools to secure your GraphQL applications. Leave with a newfound understanding of GraphQL's security landscape, a respect for its potential vulnerabilities, and a clear path to application safety.
